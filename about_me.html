    <h1>Derik Hendriksen</h1>

    <p>
        Two years ago, I went on a ski trip to Whistler in British Columbia, Canada. It was absolutely incredible and the views were like nothing I had ever seen before. 
        However, it was such a pain to get there that I probably won't ever go back.

    <h2>My Favorite Restaurant</h2>
    <p>
        One of my favorite restaurants is <a href="https://www.bowery-bar.com/" target="_blank">Bowery Bar</a>. They have an amazing vibe and have great appetizers. 
        My parents prefer simple food and always like to go there when they come to visit me. I think they have the best nachos in the world, and I'm a sucker for great
        nachos.

    <h2>My Favorite Food</h2>

    <img src="sundae.jpeg" alt="IcecreamSmith Ice Cream Sundae" class="wrap-image">
    <p>
        My current favorite food is a sweet cream ice cream sundae from the IcecreamSmith in Dorchester. The sweet cream flavor is not overpowering and perfectly
        accentuates the flavor of whatever additions you have mixed into the sundae. On top of the ice cream must go a large scoopful of the marshmallow sauce with
        a nice swirl of whipped cream to top it off. Absolute perfection.
